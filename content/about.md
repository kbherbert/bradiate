# Hi, I am Brady.

Let me tell you a bit about myself. I'm a Louisville-based web developer, currently employed as a Senior Application Architect at Humana where I specialize in building and maintaining a variety of rich online content. I am well-versed in many of the latest development standards including HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

My core work ethic revolves around identifying and solving a client’s actual needs. Flashy design rarely wins over absolute function in the real world and my portfolio strives to convey that. Whether it is a mom-and-pop business, a local restaurant or a thriving corporate portal, I strive to fulfill the client’s specific needs in an easy to use and familiar fashion that keeps up with today’s standards for online content.
